[CLS] what main difference http and http [SEP],"[CLS] http2 is a major revision of the http protocol that improves performance over http1.1. key differences include multiplexing allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection, header compression reducing overhead, and server push allowing servers to send resources to clients before they are requested. these features enhance loading speed and efficiency for modern web applications. [SEP]"
[CLS] what common programming paradigm [SEP],"[CLS] common programming paradigms include procedural programming focusing on procedures or routines, objectoriented programming using objects and classes, functional programming emphasizing pure functions and immutability, and declarative programming describing what the program should accomplish without specifying how. each paradigm has its strengths and is suited for different types of applications and problemsolving approaches. [SEP]"
[CLS] what purpose restful api design [SEP],"[CLS] restful api design provides a set of architectural constraints for creating web services that are scalable, stateless, and easily consumable. it uses standard http methods get, post, put, delete for crud operations and leverages resourcebased urls to represent data. restful apis allow for seamless communication between clients and servers, promoting interoperability and simplifying integration with various applications. [SEP]"
[CLS] how mitigate security vulnerability web application [SEP],"[CLS] mitigating security vulnerabilities in web applications involves implementing practices such as input validation to prevent injection attacks, using secure authentication mechanisms like oauth and multifactor authentication, encrypting sensitive data, and keeping software dependencies up to date. regular security audits, penetration testing, and adherence to secure coding guidelines further enhance the overall security posture of web applications. [SEP]"
[CLS] what container software development [SEP],"[CLS] containers are lightweight, portable units of software that package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that it runs consistently across different computing environments. unlike virtual machines, containers share the host os kernel, making them more efficient in terms of resource usage. tools like docker and kubernetes are popular for containerization, enabling developers to build, deploy, and manage applications easily. [SEP]"
[CLS] what agile methodology project management [SEP],"[CLS] agile methodology is an iterative approach to project management that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. it breaks projects into small, manageable increments called iterations or sprints, allowing teams to adapt to changes quickly. agile promotes continuous improvement through regular retrospectives, prioritizes delivering functional software, and encourages close collaboration between crossfunctional teams, enhancing responsiveness to user needs. [SEP]"
[CLS] what role ux designer [SEP],"[CLS] a ux user experience designer is responsible for creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. this role involves researching user needs, developing wireframes and prototypes, conducting usability testing, and collaborating with crossfunctional teams to ensure the product is userfriendly. ux designers focus on the overall feel of the product, ensuring it is intuitive and meets user expectations. [SEP]"
[CLS] what sql injection and how prevent [SEP],"[CLS] sql injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to execute arbitrary sql code on a database by manipulating input data. it can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation. prevention techniques include using parameterized queries or prepared statements, validating and sanitizing user input, and implementing proper error handling to avoid revealing database structure. [SEP]"
[CLS] what software development lifecycle [SEP],"[CLS] the software development lifecycle sdlc is a structured process that outlines the stages of software development from initial planning to deployment and maintenance. common stages include requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. following an sdlc model ensures systematic planning, execution, and monitoring of software projects, helping to improve quality and reduce risks. [SEP]"
[CLS] what sdlc [SEP],"[CLS] the software development lifecycle sdlc is a structured process that outlines the stages of software development from initial planning to deployment and maintenance. common stages include requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. following an sdlc model ensures systematic planning, execution, and monitoring of software projects, helping to improve quality and reduce risks. [SEP]"
[CLS] what orm tool [SEP],"[CLS] an orm objectrelational mapping tool is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in objectoriented programming languages. it allows developers to interact with a relational database using objectoriented paradigms, abstracting the database interactions. popular orm frameworks, such as hibernate for java and entity framework for .net, simplify database operations, reduce boilerplate code, and improve maintainability.

[CLS] what common security practice web application [SEP],"[CLS] common security practices for web applications include implementing https to encrypt data in transit, validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent injection attacks, using secure authentication methods like multifactor authentication, applying the principle of least privilege for user access, and regularly updating software to patch vulnerabilities. additionally, conducting regular security audits and penetration testing helps identify and mitigate potential threats. [SEP]"
[CLS] what difference authentication and authorization [SEP],"[CLS] authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, ensuring that they are who they claim to be, often through credentials like usernames and passwords. in contrast, authorization occurs after authentication and determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do or access within a system. while authentication confirms identity, authorization governs access rights and permissions. [SEP]"
[CLS] what purpose load balance network system [SEP],"[CLS] load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. its purpose is to enhance the availability and reliability of applications by optimizing resource use, minimizing response time, and preventing downtime. load balancers can be hardwarebased or softwarebased and are essential for maintaining performance during peak traffic periods. [SEP]"
[CLS] what key benefit use containerization software development [SEP],"[CLS] containerization provides several key benefits, includingisolation each container runs independently, preventing conflicts between applications.portability containers can run consistently across different environments, simplifying deployment.scalability containers can be easily scaled up or down to meet demand.efficiency containers use system resources more efficiently than traditional virtual machines.rapid deployment containers can be quickly deployed, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery cicd practices. [SEP]"
[CLS] how do apis facilitate integration different software application [SEP],"[CLS] application programming interfaces apis define a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. apis facilitate integration by allowing different software systems to communicate with each other, enabling data exchange and functionality sharing. by providing a standardized way to access resources and services, apis enable developers to create interconnected applications, enhance interoperability, and streamline workflows.
